This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Mongo and Mongoose

First of all you should have installed MongoDB and be able to run it before you install mongoose. You can read [this](https://alpertellioglu.medium.com/how-to-install-mongodb-on-mac-catalina-807f1e6e830e) article to see how to do that on Mac.

1. In order to install mongoose, we’ll use npm command in the project folder. But first, you should go to the relevant project folder in command line.

```
yarn add mongoose
```

2. Require mongoose in app.js / in the models or connect file
```
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
```

3. Go to `server/model/connect.js` file, here is the configuration
